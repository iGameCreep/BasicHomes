## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Here is the default `config.yml`:

```
# BasicHomes configuration file

homes:
  enabled: true
  delay: 0
  standStill: true

warps:
  enabled: true
  delay: 0
  standStill: true

op-bypass-home-limit: false
max-homes: 1
```

**Tips:**

*   `enabled`: Set to `false` to disable homes or warps.
*   `delay`: Time (in seconds) before teleportation. `0` disables delay and `standStill`.
*   `standStill`: Require players to remain still during teleportation.
*   `max-homes`: Maximum number of homes a player can have. Use `0` for no limit.
*   `op-bypass-home-limit`: Allow OPs to bypass the home limit.

## üîê Permissions

The command `/permissions` allows to grant/revoke access to a certain player, all players or OP players.
Syntax: `/permissions <set|remove|list> <player|group> <permission> <true|false>`
Usages:
- `/permissions set player Notch basichomes.warp.use false` (disallow player `Notch` from using warps)

- `/permissions remove player Notch basichomes.warp.use` (back to default settings: `Notch` has no longer the permission to false)
